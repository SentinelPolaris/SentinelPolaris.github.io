<p><strong>If you already have a computer that your are comfrotable with; you do not need to switch.</strong><br /> <br /> 
 <strong>It is perfectly fine to have a Mac and you don't need to swich if you don't want.</strong><br /> <br /> 
 <strong>Envision and school has computers that you can use if your computer is less than desirable.</strong><br /> <br /> 
 This guide is intended for new ECE students who want to purchase a new laptop due to the need of more computing power on the go. I would weight the <strong>hardware performance</strong> of the laptop more than other factors in the guide and I hope this guide would be able to help you picking you next laptop.<br>
This guide is written under the assumption that you would not have a personal desktop at your disposal to back up your need so every laptop I recommend would have a discrete Nvidia graphic card for better rendering capability in software such as <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, and additional feature, such as CUDA, which would be used latter in some of your latter courses, such ECE180 GPU programming.<br>
For convenience reason. All links I give would be Amazon links. You should check NewEgg, B&amp;H and other vendors for possible better pricing.</p>
<p>Pricing is taken at the time of writing so expect changes.</p>
<p>If you are interested in building a desktop, check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds#wiki_starter">this</a> Reddit post for more information. It is a more straight forward guide intended for gaming builds, but a good gaming Desktop is generally a good workhorse desktop as well. Note that you will have to switch AMD graphics card for Nvidia graphics card if you intended to do CUDA related thing in the future.</p>
<h1 id="standards-used-to-pick-laptops">Standards used to pick laptops</h1>
<p>Here are some geneal rules I used in determining which laptop I would recommend.</p>
<p><strong>8 gigabytes and more RAM</strong>: 64 bit system is required for most of the work you do. <strong>MatLab</strong> refuses to run on system with a 32 bit system(4G ram and lower); <strong>SolidWorks</strong> tend to give you low memory warning frequently when your system has less than 8G of ram. <strong>Instructor K. W. Morris’s</strong> laptop has 8G of ram and you would still be able to see low memory warning when he gives demonstrations.<br>

<p><strong>Nvidia graphics card</strong>: Nvidia GPU tend to be more powerful and power efficient than its competitors. Also CUDA binary does not run on AMD graphics cards.</p>
<p><strong>8th gen and above Intel CPU</strong>: most if not all of the 8th gen and above Intel CPUs have four physical cores comparing the two physical cores of all previous generation while maintaining similar power consumption and pricing(thanks to the pressure from the AMD side).</p>
<p><strong>Solid State Drive</strong>: Faster disk accessing speed is always great.</p>
<p><strong>15 inch screen</strong>: 15 inch screen laptop is nicely balanced between weight, price and performance. Also larger than 13 inch screen is beneficial for writing codes.</p>
<p><strong>Why MacBooks are not in the list</strong>: Generally speaking Mac books are less powerful hardware wise comparing to laptops from other manufacturers(at same price point), and there are several major issues of Macs that renders them less effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of software you will be using as engineers are Windows only 
</li><li>Macs do not have discrete GPU on most models
</li><li>Apple's philosophy on minimalist I/O is not beneficial for engineers
</li><li>When under pressure, Macs have the tendency to lower CPU speed to cope with thermal issues rather than ramping up fans to dissipate the heat. Essentially, Macs would not be able to maintain advertised clock speed for an extended duration of time. Gentries in Starbucks don't mind trading performance for lower noise and aesthetics but you do.
</li><li>Expensive

<h1 id="dollar-and-above">1000 Dollar and Above</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>At above 1000 dollar you would have a lot more options. Many $1000+ laptop also have multiple different configurations. From here and now I will just make general recommendations rather than specific model. However I do want to point out the following product. Almost all of these would be more than enough for academic purposes.</p>
